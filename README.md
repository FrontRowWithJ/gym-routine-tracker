## About

To regularly go to the gym, I need to overcome a set of challenges. Some of them are:
<ul>
  <li>
    I need to have knowledge of a multitude of different exercises for each of the muscles that I want to target.
  </li>
  <li>
    I need to keep track of the amount of resistance that I have applied to each exercise.
  </li>
  <li>
    I need quick access to knowledge on how to perform these exercises in case I forget or to prevent me from hurting myself.
  </li>
  <li>
    I need some way of modifying the set of exercises to suit my needs.
  </li>
  <li>
    And I need to distribute the exercises so that no major muscle group is left ignored.
  </li>
</ul>
For someone who is new to the gym with the intention of forming new habits, having to overcome these challenges can make going to the gym really offputting
so the purpose of this app is to hopefully solve or at least address these issues.
